Giving a brief about the code:
So we can see a rich text editor and two buttons on is submit and other is export
->Submit button is disabled till we dont type anything in text editor which saves us from clicking the submit button and adding null data to the todoList
->The export button is disabled if there are not any todo items.So that we dont generate empty PDFS
->If we are trying to add data to todo list using Submit we can see the spinner and data getting dynamically added to the TODO LIST.
->Each todo item will have a done button which upon clicking will remove the record from todo list.
->with the help of export button we can get the pdf with todo List items.
